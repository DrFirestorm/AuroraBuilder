# AuroraBuilder
5e homebrew content for Aurora Builder coded by DrFirestorm, mostly at the request of others.

All of this homebrew content is created by other people unless specifically noted. I don't create homebrew content, but I enjoy making them work in Aurora Builder.

Please contact me on Discord (DrFirestorm#8339) about any bugs, suggestions, or content requests.

**Index Files**

Each XML file will have its own Index file that you can place in the 'custom\user' folder to have Aurora Builder automatically check for updates for that specific file.

There is also drfirestorm.index that is linked to all my content if you want all my current and future content automatically updated in Aurora Builder.
