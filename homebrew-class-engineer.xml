			<p>Masters of mechanical mayhem, engineers love to tinker with explosives, elixirs, and all manner of hazardous gadgets. They can take control of an area by placing turrets, support their allies with alchemical weaponry, or lay waste to foes with a wide array of mines, bombs, and grenades.</p>
			<h4>CREATING AN ENGINEER</h4>
			<p>When creating an engineer, think about how your character learned the skills needed to work with machines. Did they teach themselves? Or were they trained by a guild or society of engineers? Perhaps they come from a culture like that of dwarves and gnomes where such skills are common. Or perhaps they just figured it out for themselves through experimentation.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make an engineer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the engineer's background.</p>
			<h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
			<p>As an Engineer, you gain the following class features.</p>
			<h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per engineer level</li>
				<li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
				<li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per engineer level after 1st</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor</li>
				<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, all Firearms (DM's guide), Heavy Crossbow, Hand Crossbow, Crossbow</li>

				<li>3 Energy- As an action you may shoot an energy beam at a target within 10ft. This causes force damage equal to 2d6+your engineer level. You can spend one additional energy points to force the target to make a Str save. On a failure, it is sent flying back 5ft per engineer level, taking appropriate falling damage if it collides with an obstacle. Huge or larger creatures gain advantage in this check and are only pushed back half the distance.</li>

A creature this is splashed on, or an unwilling creature that who spits it out, must succeed on a Con save or be affected.</li>
				<li><em>Potion of Invisibility.</em> A creature who drinks this potion is invisible for 1 minute upon ingesting.</li>
				<li><em>Potion of Massive Strength.</em> The drinker's Strength score is 23 for 1 hour. This potion fails if their Strength score is already that high.</li>
				<li><em>Potion of Swift Reflexes.</em> The drinker's Dexterity score is 23 for 1 hour. This potion fails if their Dexterity score is already that high.</li>
				<li><em>Potion of High Durability.</em> The drinker's Constitution score is 23 for 1 hour. This potion fails if their Constitution score is already that high.</li>

				<li><em>Superior Poison.</em> Upon ingestion, wounding, or splashing, a creature must succeed on a Con save or take 3d10+Engineer level poison damage. On a failure, a creature is also poisoned for 1 minute.</li>
				<li><em>Plaguebringer's Poison.</em> Upon ingestion, wounding or splashing, the target is affected as if by Contagion.</li>

				<li><em>Sweet Poison.</em> Upon ingestion, a creature must succeed at a Wis save or permanently fall in love with the first creature it perceives. If it wouldn't normally be attracted to the creature, it instead feels a strong platonic adoration. Remove Curse or similar effects allow the creature to attempt a new Wis save.</li>
